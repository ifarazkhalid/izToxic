# izToxic


**izToxic** is a solution to the Toxic Comment classification kaggle challenge. 

# Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

We are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:
- Toxic
- Severe Toxic
- Obscene
- Insult
- Threat
- Identity Hate

# Solution Overview

**izToxic** solution was simplified and I broke the whole problem into 6 different problems. Instead of performing multimonimal classification, each comment was used to do binary classification and predict only one category at a time.

# Exploration

Doing this project, I learned about SparkR and how to efficiently use it do classfication of comments in Apache Spark.
